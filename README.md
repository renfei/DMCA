## Purpose of This Repository

This public repository archives all DMCA takedown notices and copyright complaints received by **RENFEI.NET** (https://www.renfei.net).

As the owner and operator of RENFEI.NET, I created this repository to:

- Demonstrate full **transparency** in how copyright complaints are handled
- Allow copyright owners to easily verify that their notice has been received and processed
- Show the community my commitment to respecting intellectual property rights
- Welcome public oversight and prevent any perception of “silent” or hidden removals

I respect copyright worldwide. Every valid DMCA notice is processed through the official channel will be recorded here (with personal information of the complainant redacted for privacy).

## How to Submit a DMCA Takedown Notice

Please send your formal DMCA notice to:  
**i@renfei.net**

The notice must contain all elements required by the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512), including but not limited to:

- Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed
- Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing (with specific URLs on RENFEI.NET)
- Your contact information
- A statement of good faith belief that the use is not authorized
- A statement that the information in the notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner
- A physical or electronic signature

## Special Note for Complaints Regarding the BT Tracker Server

RENFEI.NET operates an open BitTorrent tracker (http://tracker.renfei.net:8080/announce) for technical testing and research purposes.

**Important facts about the tracker**:

- The tracker **does not host, store, or transmit** any torrent files or copyrighted content.
- The tracker only provides a simple list of peer IP addresses and ports to help BitTorrent clients connect with each other.
- The tracker has no knowledge of the actual file names or contents being shared.

If you wish to file a complaint about content distributed via this tracker, please include the following required information in your DMCA notice:

- The **Info Hash** (SHA-1 or SHA-256 hash) of the torrent you claim is infringing  
  (example: `info_hash=A1B2C3D4E5F6...` or displayed as Magnet link `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:A1B2C3D4…`
- Proof of copyright ownership
- All other standard DMCA elements listed above

Notices that only contain a magnet link or torrent name **without the exact info hash** cannot be processed, because the tracker cannot identify the swarm without it.

Once a valid notice containing the correct info hash is received, the tracker will immediately remove that hash from its announce list (usually within minutes).

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

## Processing Workflow

1. Notice received → Acknowledgment sent within 24 hours
2. Review for DMCA compliance
3. If valid → Infringing content is removed or disabled immediately
4. Redacted copy of the notice is published in this repository
5. Counter-notices are also accepted at the same email address and will be handled according to DMCA procedures

## Record of All Notices

All past and future takedown notices are listed here:  
→ [DMCA-Records.md](./DMCA-Records.md)
→ [BitTorrent-Tracker-Blacklisted-InfoHash.md](/BitTorrent-Tracker-Blacklisted-InfoHash.md)

Original (redacted) emails or PDFs are stored in the `/records/` folder.

## Additional Statement

Although RENFEI.NET servers are located in China, I voluntarily follow the DMCA safe-harbor process for all global copyright complaints out of respect for international creators.  
I do not ignore or delay legitimate requests—this repository is public proof of that commitment.
